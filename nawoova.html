<!-- About Me Section -->
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Nawoova Gatrude</strong>, born in 2011. I am a lively and curious Primary 7 student at <strong>St. Savio Junior School, Kisubi</strong>. Every day at school is a new adventure filled with learning, fun, and laughter with friends and teachers.</p>
    <p>Outside the classroom, I love exploring my creative side through dance, comedy skits, and participating in school activities. I believe that learning can be exciting when we mix it with joy and creativity. Sports are my way to stay active, healthy, and full of energy. Whether it’s running, football, or games with friends, I always try to give my best.</p>
    <p>Life at home is filled with love and inspiration. Being the daughter of my amazing mother, <strong>Namuganga Agnes</strong>, who is a herbalist and entrepreneur, motivates me to dream big, work hard, and always be kind to others. I hope to grow up with the same dedication, creativity, and joy that I see in her every day.</p>

Weekends are my favorite – a time to play, laugh, and sometimes help my mother in little ways while learning about her work.</p>
    <p>I believe that every day is an opportunity to learn, create, and share joy. Staying curious, positive, and active makes life exciting and fulfilling.</p>
